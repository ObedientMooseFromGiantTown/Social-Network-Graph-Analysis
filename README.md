# Exploratory Data Analysis on Instagram Connections Network 

This project is only an educational project and has no other purpose. Also, the data extraction is not done by any automated bots, and due to the small number of the data points, it was collected manually.

No username is used in the repository, and the report.

## Input
1. Put you follower names in `all_names.csv`.
2. Create a folder named `users`, and for each follower, create a file including the mutual follower, each in one line.
3. Export the `Cluster.csv`, including two columns: `[Name, Cluster]`
4. Run the notebook.
